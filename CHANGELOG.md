Changelog
=========

0.1.2
-----

- Dropped Bignum support. Automatic conversion from Fixnum to Bignum (or vice versa)
  will produce columns whose values are of heterogeneous types, that are impossible to be read in a consistent way.
  You can use BigDecimal type instead for large numbers.
- Added `HBase::Scope#while` which allows early termination of scan
  with [WhileMatchFilter](http://hbase.apache.org/apidocs/org/apache/hadoop/hbase/filter/WhileMatchFilter.html)
- Filtering with regular expressions
